# meow-pi

# Part 01

* Create Express App `express <AppName> --git`
* `npm install mongoose mongoose-unique-validator nodemon`
* reconfigure npm scripts in our package.json to `"start": "nodemon ./bin/www"`
* Create a git repo on Github, and push or init commit, please

npm run scripts

```js
//windows
"start": "set DEBUG=meow-pi:* & nodemon ./bin/www"
//mac
"start": "DEBUG=meow-pi:* nodemon ./bin/www"
```

# Part 02

* `npm install dotenv` and create a .env for our configs
* Add .env to your .gitignore
* This is where you'll put environment config stuff. Like the url for our db
* Create API routes, api folder,w/ index.js file
* Require API route and wire up app.use for articles

# Part 03

* Articles Model with basic properties
* and our '/api/articles' with a GET request now returns a hardcoded 10, in
  order of most recent 'createdAt'
* We should now be able to use [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) and do a
  GET request to 'localhost:3000/api/articles' and see 10 articles of the more
  recent come back!

# Part 04

* User Model `npm install bcrypt-nodejs`
* Bcrypt, hashing & storing passwords
* Users route for login at '/api/users/login'

# Part 05

* Configure Passport for JWT and for Local
* Apply to User Login endpoint '/api/users/login'
* Passport will need 2 strategies, local and jwt. We've got a root file
  'passport.js' that will have a new instance of each strategy.
* We've had to back track on comparePassword and our pre-save methods to use
  crypto instead of bycrypt. Why? Because the server that has been inputing info
  thus far, has been using a particular hash that we need to follow.
* Once passport local has verified the user email and password, it will append
  that user object to the request object, and call next.

```js
npm install passport passport-jwt passport-local jwt-simple, crypto
```

* email and password for login verify

```js
{
      "email":"meow@pants.com",
      "password":"testing001"
}
```
